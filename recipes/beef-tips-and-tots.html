        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of beef round steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato ngugets (such as Tater Tots)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. 
                Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, 
                and then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, 
                about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets.</li>
        </ol>
